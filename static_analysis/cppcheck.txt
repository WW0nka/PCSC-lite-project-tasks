----------------------------------COMMENT--------------------------------------------------
Although most are style errors, there is 1 error that can lead to lost memory if reallocation fails.
Then there are 4 warnings, 2 of which are false positives of sscanf() usage with '%s', but the string to be read is set to some maximum lenght.
The other 2 are using alloca() which basically allocates memory on the stack, which "frees" itself at the end of the function.
