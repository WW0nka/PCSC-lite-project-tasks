AdLint - not used, old for ANSI C89 / ISO C90 and partly ISO C99.
Astree - NOT FREE. There is a trial for 30 days after you email/fax them a license agreement, set a date and time for a Web-based training via cisco webex and a regular phone call that takes (I presume) painful 90 minutes. ***DROP MIC***
