AdLint - not used, old for ANSI C89 / ISO C90 and partly ISO C99.
Astree - NOT FREE. There is a trial for 30 days after you email/fax them a license agreement, set a date and time for a Web-based training via cisco webex and a regular phone call that takes (I presume) painful 90 minutes. ***DROP MIC***
Axivion Bauhaus Suite – A static code analysis tool suite that performs various analyses such as architecture checking, interface analyses, MISRA checking, and clone detection.
BLAST – so far not used, maybe later, analyzis only one .c file, getting parse errors
Cppcheck – Open-source tool that checks for several types of errors, including use of STL. ***DONE***
cpplint – An open-source tool that checks for compliance with Google's style guide for C++ coding.
Clang – An open-source compiler that includes a static analyzer.
Coccinelle – An open-source source code pattern matching and transformation. *** THIS IS `sed` ON STEROIDS, NOT AN ANALYZER ***
Coverity – A static analysis tool for C/C++.
Cppdepend – Simplifies managing a complex C/C++ code base by analyzing and visualizing code dependencies, by defining design rules, by doing impact analysis, and comparing different versions of the code.
