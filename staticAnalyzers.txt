AdLint is an open source and free source code static analyzer for ANSI C89 / ISO C90 and partly ISO C99.
Astrée – finds all potential runtime errors and data races by abstract interpretation, can prove their absence, and can prove functional assertions; tailored towards safety-critical C code (e.g. avionics and automotive). Includes MISRA checker.
Axivion Bauhaus Suite – A static code analysis tool suite that performs various analyses such as architecture checking, interface analyses, MISRA checking, and clone detection.
BLAST – (Berkeley Lazy Abstraction Software verification Tool) – An open-source software model checker for C programs based on lazy abstraction (follow-on project is CPAchecker.[5]).
Cppcheck – Open-source tool that checks for several types of errors, including use of STL.
cpplint – An open-source tool that checks for compliance with Google's style guide for C++ coding.
Clang – An open-source compiler that includes a static analyzer.
Coccinelle – An open-source source code pattern matching and transformation.
Coverity – A static analysis tool for C/C++.
Cppdepend – Simplifies managing a complex C/C++ code base by analyzing and visualizing code dependencies, by defining design rules, by doing impact analysis, and comparing different versions of the code.
ECLAIR – A platform for the automatic analysis, verification, testing and transformation of C and C++ programs.
Eclipse (software) – An open-source IDE that includes a static code analyzer.

PC-Lint – A software analysis tool for C with partial support for C++2011.
Polyspace – Uses abstract interpretation to detect and prove the absence of run time errors, Dead Code in source code as well as used to check all MISRA (2004, 2012) rules (directives, non directives).
PRQA QA·C and QA·C++ – Deep static analysis of C/C++ for quality assurance and guideline/coding standard enforcement with MISRA support.
SLAM project – a project of Microsoft Research for checking that software satisfies critical behavioral properties of the interfaces it uses.
Sparse – An open-source tool designed to find faults in the Linux kernel.
Splint – An open-source evolved version of Lint, for C.
