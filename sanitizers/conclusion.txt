We tried to run clang's:

- AdressSanitizer
- MemorySanitizer
- UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer
- DataFlowSanitizer

We used clang 3.5 version and after the make process, some of the required symbolic links to libs directories were missing, so they were added manually. When we started the daemon nothing happens, it seems like it is in the infinite loop at the beginning of a startup; also couple of another errors related mainly to dependencies appeard.

Using clang 5.0.0, AdressSanitizer works, however no bug found.
